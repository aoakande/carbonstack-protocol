### Smart Contract Interface

#### Registry Contract
```clarity
(define-public (register-device (device-id (string-ascii 64)) (location (string-ascii 64)))
```
Registers an IoT device for carbon capture measurement.

#### Carbon Credit Contract
```clarity
(define-public (issue-credit (amount uint) (device-id (string-ascii 64)))
```
Issues new carbon credits based on verified measurements.
